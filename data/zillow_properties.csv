Lots of character and charm throughout.   there are a lot of built-ins.  A chimney with a new, efficient, cast-iron insert fireplace with a glass door - heats up the whole front of the house for hours with one log.  Built-in china cabinet, built in secretary, bookcases, hall cabinets, dresser with large mirror in the master bedroom.  There is a ""sister"" closet that goes through the bedrooms - you can walk through from one bedroom to the other. 

The ""bones"" of this house are great.  NEW FOUNDATION 2009!  New 2 car garage, 2010.  New wiring to Romax 2009.  Seamless gutters, drains and rainwater recapture for gardening.  New drains and sewer pipe to alley 2010.  Solar, radiant floor heat, hardwood floors throughout, new garage, privacy fence.  NEEDS - updated kitchen and bath - can update to Buyer's details prior to closing to make move-in ready.  The bath has a new, not reconditioned, ball and claw soaker tub with a shower.   Hot water for both the radiant floor heat (the floors and attic are heavily insulated) is supplied by two on-demand electric water heaters.  The solar provides enough power to have zero electricity bills.  

One of the things I really like about this house is the radiant floor heat.  Set the smart thermostat for a time and temperature and at that time, the temperature will be exactly correct.  There are 4 zones for heating - front, middle, rear of the house and the garage.  Yes, the garage temperature can be controlled and I keep it controlled because it's my ""man cave"" where I have a pool table and other things that are sensitive to extreme temperature swings.  There are three heating systems - fireplace, forced air (that I never use), and radiant floor heat.  

I also love my whole house and whole garage ceiling exhaust fans.  Without air conditioning, I can make the temperature of the inside of the house or garage the same as the outside temperature very quickly.  I will admit that a/c would be nice given the heat we've experienced, but I haven't put in central a/c.  

My friends tell me that this is a farmhouse.  I have two beehives and a pet chicken.  The yard is landscaped to hold water for fruit trees that I water with rainwater.   There are three productive (100+ pounds) grapevines (red, purple and green seedless.  The orange, pear, fig, loquat, lemon, and pomegranate trees are all very productive.   A dwarf apple has small production (I have some larger apple trees and a macadamia nut tree seedlings growing to replace.)  There is a cherry tree that isn't yet productive, but it will be.  A mulberry tree is new.  For shade there is a camphor and a jacaranda.   Big bushes at the entrance give privacy.  I have random fruits and vegetables growing around the yard that change with the seasons and my whims.  The house and property will be exceptionally attractive to someone who wants to take care of the fruit trees and do gardening.  A buyer who wants a maintenance free yard will not and won't find value.  

My pricing assumes that a Realtor might find the Buyer; however, I will not reduce the price for a Buyer without a Realtor.  The savings on a commission is for the Seller.  The Seller pays the commission.  My price also is a ""make me move"" price.  I believe it is high for comparable homes that are ""move in ready"".  I am making some improvements as I go.  I'm restoring kitchen cabinets and may put in new counters.  The problem with new counters is that a Buyer might change them anyway.  I'm going to replace a missing built in cabinet door in the bathroom.  "

The topography is such that the home feels immensely private - barely visible from the street - yet open and exposed to the gorgeous Pacific Ocean and rocky coastline that creates drama with mesmerizing waves and sea spray that refreshes your senses. 

The home was designed by Frederick Liebhardt, a student and disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, as the personal residence for his mother. The home was later remodeled with a design by Henry Hester, another prominent mid-century modern architect who had at one point been partners with Liebhardt. Most recently it was updated by Hill Construction and NYC designer Eddie Lee who modernized the interior to accentuate the clean lines, inviting spaces and indoor/outdoor flow that drove the original concept, while adding details to further the comfort and beach vibe of such a sophisticated home.

Living largely like a single level with the master, kitchen and all living and entertaining spaces on the entry level, the home is excellent for both formal entertaining and casual day-to-day living. His and hers master baths/closets, a central pool protected from cool ocean breezes, an expansive teak ocean view deck, and floor-to-ceiling glass as well as French doors are just the beginning of the amenities that enhance the enjoyment of the lifestyle that comes with such a phenomenal location."
